Title$$
Homemade Ozark Rootbeer recipe$$
Preparation$$
Mix all ingredients in a keg, add water to fill keg, carbonate, drink. Some 
comments regarding the recipe: I thought the molasses taste was a bit 
harsh, I will try regular molasses next time and perhaps use a little less 
as well. I will try substituting 2 oz of sasparilla extract for 2 oz of the 
rootbeer extract. In any case, you can mix the ingredients to your taste. 
This recipe produces a strong tasting rootbeer with about half the 
sweetness of most commercial rootbeers (warning: you will want to clean 
your draft lines after dispensing this root beer, it leaves a flavor 
behind). It was extremely popular with the underage college crowd because 
the rootbeer was served just like draft beer. You can obtain the extracts 
in 2 oz bottles at most homebrewing shops. In addition, you can buy bulk 
extracts through restaurant suppliers, the one brand I know of is 
'Universal'. While I artifically carbonated my rootbeer (for both legal & 
practical reasons) you could ferment it to get carbonation. There was an 
alcoholic rootbeer at the Great American Beer Festival, I talked with the 
brewmaster who made it, and it is similar to my recipe, but with the 
addition of a substantial amount of malt extract to increase the 
fermentables. His rootbeer was in the 6% alcohol by weight range, and 
tasted very good on it's own, but didn't go well with drinking lots of 
regular beer.$$

Coffee Frosting recipe$$
Preparation$$
Mix sugar, corn syrup and water in 1-quart saucepan. Cover and heat to 
rolling boil over medium heat. Uncover and cook, without stirring, to 242 
degrees on candy thermometer or until small amount of mixture dropped into 
very cold water forms a ball that flattens when removed from water. To get 
an accurate temperature reading it may be necessary to tilt the saucepan 
slightly. It takes 4 to 8 minutes for the syrup to reach 242 degrees.While 
mixture boils, beat egg whites in medium bowl just until stiff peaks form. 
Pour hot syrup very slowly in thin stream into egg whites, beating 
constantly on medium speed. Add vanilla and instant coffee. Beat on high 
speed about 10 minutes until stiff peaks form. Preparing this type of 
frosting on a humid day may require a longer beating time. Frosts a 13 X 
9-inch cake or fills and frosts two 8- or 9-inch cake layers.$$

Cranberry Juice (homemade) recipe$$
Preparation$$
Produces 5c juice very rapidly from a small packet of berries. Cranberries 
keep virtually forever in the freezer. After extracting the juice you will 
have the pulp which needs only sugar and a few seconds' boiling to become a 
flavorful coarse-textured cranberry sauce. The cost of the combined 
products is very low. Rich in Vit C; medicinal value. Wash berries and put 
into a saucepan with water, orange slices, and salt. Turn berries, opt 
orange slices, and liquid into a cheese-cloth-lined sieve. Strain the juice 
without pressing and reserve the berry and orange pulp to make HOME-STYLE 
CRANBERRY SAUCE. Return juice to pot with sugar and boil 2-3 mins. Taste, 
add more sugar if needed. Cool and chill$$
